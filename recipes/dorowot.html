  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Preparation:</li>
     <ol>
      <li>Clean the Chicken</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Cut the whole chicken into pieces (8-12).</li>
        <li>Rub the chicken pieces with lemon juice and salt to clean and tenderize.</li>
        <li>Rinse well with water and set aside.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Prepare Ingredients:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Finely chop the onions.</li>
        <li>Mince the garlic and ginger.</li>
        <li>Prepare hard-boiled eggs by boiling them, peeling them, and setting them aside.</li>
      </ul>
     </ol>
     <li>Cooking:</li>
     <ol>
      <li>Caramelize the Onions:</li>
       <ul>
        <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or skillet, heat the pan over medium heat (traditionally, onions are cooked without oil initially).</li>
        <li>Add the finely chopped onions and cook on low heat, stirring frequently until they become soft and light brown. This may take around 15-20 minutes. Ensure they do not burn.</li>
       </ul>
       <li>Add the Niter Kibbeh:</li>
       <ul>
        <li>Once the onions are caramelized, add the niter kibbeh (or regular butter/oil if not available).</li>
        <li>Stir well to combine and let the onions cook for another 5-7 minutes, allowing the butter to meld with the onions.</li>
       </ul>
       <li>Add Berbere and Other Spices:</li>
       <ul>
        <li>Add 3-4 tablespoons of berbere spice blend to the mixture.
        </li>
        <li>Stir continuously and cook for about 5-10 minutes, allowing the spices to blend and develop their flavor. Add a little water if the mixture becomes too dry.</li>
       </ul>
       <li>Incorporate Garlic and Ginger:</li>
       <ul>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and ginger. Stir and cook for another 3-5 minutes until fragrant.</li>
       </ul>
       <li>Add Tomato Paste:</li>
       <ul>
        <li>Mix in 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and cook for another 5 minutes, ensuring all ingredients are well combined.</li>
       </ul>
       <li>Add Chicken Pieces:</li>
       <ul>
        <li>Place the chicken pieces into the pot, turning them to coat well with the spice mixture.</li>
        <li>Cook for 10-15 minutes, occasionally stirring to ensure the chicken is well covered with the spice mixture.</li>
       </ul>
       <li>Add Broth and Simmer:</li>
       <ul>
        <li>Pour in 2-3 cups of chicken broth (or water) to cover the chicken.</li>
        <li>Add salt, black pepper, and any additional spices (like cardamom, fenugreek, and korarima).</li>
        <li>Cover and simmer on low heat for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the chicken is fully cooked and tender.</li>
       </ul>
       <li>Add Hard-Boiled Eggs:</li>
       <ul>
        <li>Add the peeled hard-boiled eggs to the stew in the last 10-15 minutes of cooking.</li>
        <li>Make small slits in the eggs so they can absorb the stew flavors.</li>
       </ul>
        <li>Finish and Adjust Seasoning:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Taste the stew and adjust seasoning with more salt or spices as needed.</li>
          <li>Let it simmer uncovered for the last few minutes to thicken the sauce if desired.</li>
        </ul>
     </ol>
     <li>Serve:</li>
     <ul>
      <li>Serve Doro Wot hot with injera (Ethiopian flatbread), rice, or bread.</li>
      <li>Garnish with fresh coriander or parsley, if desired.</li>
     </ul>
  </ul>
